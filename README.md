Styla Widget  0.0.2
===================
The Styla Widgetâ„¢ is a simple way to display stories from a Styla Magazine in a
smaller format, anywhere on your site. A story in the widget functions as
a teaser and will send the reader directly to the magazine when clicked on.

Stories can be filtered based on author, tag and category.
